# Site Reliability Infrastructure Automation & Observability Project

## Overview

This project demonstrates a comprehensive end-to-end site reliability infrastructure automation and observability solution, built with standard tools and cloud technologies.

## Features

- **Cloud Infrastructure Provisioning:** Automated setup of cloud resources using IaC (Infrastructure as Code) principles.
- **Container Orchestration:** Deployment and management of application containers using industry-standard orchestration tools.
- **CI/CD Pipeline:** Implementation of a continuous integration and continuous deployment pipeline for automated application delivery.
- **Monitoring & Observability:** Integration of monitoring, logging, and alerting to ensure system health and rapid incident response.

## Project Lifecycle

This repository covers the full lifecycle of modern, reliable cloud infrastructure:

1. **Provisioning:** Automates creation of all required cloud resources.
2. **Containerization:** Packages applications as containers for consistency and scalability.
3. **Orchestration:** Manages containers using robust orchestration platforms.
4. **CI/CD Setup:** Automates code builds, tests, and deployments.
5. **Monitoring & Observability:** Monitors infrastructure and application health with best-practice tools.

## Technologies Used

- Terraform (for cloud provisioning)
- Docker & Kubernetes (for containerization and orchestration)
- Jenkins/GitHub Actions (for CI/CD)
- Prometheus, Grafana, ELK Stack (for monitoring and observability)
- [Your chosen cloud provider: AWS, Azure, or GCP]

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository.
2. Review the module and configuration files in each directory.
3. Follow the instructions in each subfolder for provisioning, deployment, and setting up observability.
